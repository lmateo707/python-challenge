# python-challenge

I felt a lot more comfortable during this weeks homework compared to the VBA-Challenge. What helped me the most was being able to work through the homework with my tutor, Justin Moore.

In both PyBank and PyPoll, there will be a few things missing as well as incorrect data. My time with my tutor only lasted long enough for me to get started in the right direction.
  PyBank, in this activity, I am missing the months attached to the prices in 'Greatest Increase' and 'Greatest Decrease'
  PyPoll, in this activity the election results are correct but the data itself is off.
